Description: Contains functions to simulate the most commonly used 
    'SAS®' procedures.  Specifically, the package aims to 
    simulate the functionality of 'proc freq', 'proc means', 'proc ttest',
    'proc transpose', 'proc sort', and 'proc print'. 
    The simulation will include recreating 
    all statistics with the highest fidelity possible.
